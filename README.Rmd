## Overview

`trafficCAR` is an R package for constructing conditional autoregressive (CAR) precision matrices on graph and road network data. The package is designed to support methodological and simulation-based work with intrinsic and proper CAR models defined on network structures.

Core functionality includes:

- Building graph representations from spatial road geometries

- Constructing adjacency and weight matrices

- Generating ICAR and proper CAR precision matrices


## Installation

The package is under development and not available on CRAN.  
Install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mell00/trafficCAR")
```
