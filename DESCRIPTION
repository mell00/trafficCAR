Description: Tools for simulating and modeling traffic flow on road networks
    using spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) models. The package
    represents road systems as graphs derived from OpenStreetMap data and
    supports network-based spatial dependence, basic preprocessing, and
    visualization for spatio-temporal traffic analysis.
