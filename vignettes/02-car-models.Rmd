## Conditional autoregressive (CAR) models

Let \(A\) be the adjacency matrix of a graph and
\(D = \mathrm{diag}(A \mathbf{1})\).

### ICAR model

\[
Q = \tau (D - A)
\]

- Singular
- Rank deficiency equals number of connected components
- Improper prior
- Requires constraints (e.g. sum-to-zero)

### Proper CAR model

\[
Q = \tau (D - \rho A)
\]

- Positive definite if \(|\rho| < 1 / \lambda_{\max}(D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2})\)
- Interpretable spatial dependence parameter
- Reduces to ICAR as \(\rho \to 1\)

### Scaling (Sørbye–Rue)

ICAR precision is scaled so that the geometric mean of marginal variances is 1,
making \(\tau\) comparable across graphs.
